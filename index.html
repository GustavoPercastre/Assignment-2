    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <p>What do you hope to learn in your HTML/CSS course?</p>
<br>
    <p class="bolding">I hope to create my own website, so it can be my portfolio.</p>
    <p>I would also like to learn how to add animations onto said website.</p>
    <p>And finally I would like to learn how to manage a website.</p>
